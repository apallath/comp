Solutions to Programming Contest/Practice Problems

These are solutions to some algorithmic practice/challenge problems that I've solved.
None of the problems here are from ongoing contests.
These are mainly for my personal reference - as I do want to have solutions to problems I've solved handy. But you're welcome if you find these helpful :)

Additional Notes:
- uDebug is really useful when a problem you're trying on UVa Online Judge doesn't get AC'd
- spojtoolkit does the same task for SPOJ
